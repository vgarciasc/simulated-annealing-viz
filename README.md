# What is it? 

A web visualization tool of the **Simulated Annealing** (SA) algorithm, applied to the 2D clustering problem. The goal is to make crystal clear how the algorithm works, and to achieve that we provide:

1. The pseudo-code running in real-time;
2. The ability to advance the algorithm step-by-step;
3. The current values of each variable;
4. The 2D visualization of each solution;
5. An explanation of how the algorithm works.
